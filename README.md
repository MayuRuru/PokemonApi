## Consuming the Pokemon API

🎮 Application to display a list of Pokemons using [this API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon).

**Minimum requirements**🚀 
* Elements of list must show name and image of the pokemon.
* It is no allowed to use a CSS framework for custom design.
* It is allowed to use JS vanila or a framework of choice.
* Github repository with a readme.

**Other features**😜 
* I added buttons to navigate to previous or next grids if available.
* I refactored with a customized hook for anatomic design.
* I created a local variable for using the API endpoint.
* Plus, decided to show different provided front or back images wether they are female or male pokemons.
